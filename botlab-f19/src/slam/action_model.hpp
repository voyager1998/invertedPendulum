* ActionModel implements the sampling-based odometry action model for estimating the motion of the robot between
* time t and t'.
* 
* An action model is used to propagate a sample from the prior distribution, x, into
* the proposal distribution, x', based on the supplied motion estimate of the robot
* in the time interval [t, t'].
*
* To use the ActionModel, a two methods exist:
*
*   - bool updateAction(const pose_xyt_t& odometry);
*   - particle_t applyAction(const particle_t& sample);
*
* updateAction() provides the most recent odometry data so the action model can update the distributions from
* which it will sample.
*
* applyAction() applies the action to the provided sample and returns a new sample that can be part of the proposal 
* distribution for the particle filter.
